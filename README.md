# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

Stock Price Predictor is a machine learning project that leverages historical stock market data to predict future stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. This project uses data from Yahoo Finance and implements a time-series forecasting model to help predict trends in stock prices.

## 🌟 Features

- **Time Series Forecasting** using LSTM model
- Historical stock data retrieval from **Yahoo Finance**
- Data visualization for better understanding of trends
- Highly customizable for other stock tickers and time periods
- A beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning with stock data

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KoustavDeveloper/stock-price-predictor.git
cd stock-price-predictor
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download Stock Data

You can download the historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance using the following script. Replace the stock ticker and date range as per your preference.

```bash
python data/download_stock_data.py
```

This will download the stock data for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** by default and save it as `data/stock_data.csv`.

### 5. Run the Stock Price Predictor

```bash
python main.py
```

This will train the LSTM model using the stock data and output the predictions.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

This project utilizes the following machine learning and data science concepts:

- **LSTM Networks**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels at learning and forecasting from time series data.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Using historical data to predict future values.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the dataset to feed it into the model.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting stock price data and predictions.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Keras**: Deep learning library (with TensorFlow backend)
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning tools
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Yahoo Finance**: For stock data retrieval
